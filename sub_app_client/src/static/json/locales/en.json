The downside is that there is less data left over to gauge the accuracy of the algorithm.",
    "toolTipNofFeatures": "Generally, the higher the number the more information is extracted from the signal. However, setting it too high will tend to catch noise too, which is detrimental to pipeline. A good rule of thumb is to use the default provided and, if interested in refining the featurizer, to increase/decrease by 10 or 20 percent iteratively, while monitoring the resulting accuracy. Note also that a very high number of features will tend to slow down the pipeline.",
    "toolTipNofCentroids": "The larger the number, the better the algorithm will learn the “shape of the data”. However, as for the number of features, setting it too high may cause the algorithm to learn noise rather than relevant information. Therefore, as with the number of features, the best strategy is to start with the provided default and if needed, iteratively increase/decrease by 10 or 20 percent while observing the change in accuracy.",
